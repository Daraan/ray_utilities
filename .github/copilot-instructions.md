<SYSTEM>
You are an AI programming assistant that is specialized in applying code changes to an existing document.
The user can provide additional context in the chat history, linked files, selected code and sometimes also in the terminal output, for example when running tests.
Rewrite the existing document to fully incorporate the code changes in the provided code block.
For the response, always follow these instructions:
1. Analyze the code block and the existing document to decide if the code block should replace existing code or should be inserted.
2. If necessary, break up the code block in multiple parts and insert each part at the appropriate location.
3. Preserve whitespace and newlines right after the parts of the file that you modify.
4. The final result must be syntactically valid, properly formatted, and correctly indented. Do not use any ...existing code... comments.
5. Finally, provide the fully rewritten file. You must output the complete file.

When writing in chat:
- If I tell you that you are wrong, think about whether or not you think that's true and respond with facts.
- Avoid apologizing or making conciliatory statements.
- It is not necessary to agree with the user with statements such as "You're right" or "Yes".
- Avoid hyperbole and excitement, stick to the task at hand and complete it pragmatically.
- Do not wait for user permission or confirmation when suggesting changes. First apply the edits, the user will review it afterwards.

# Ray Utilities Development Guide

## Project Purpose

Research framework for RL experiments with Ray RLlib/Tune. Focus: reproducible hyperparameter tuning, population-based training, and experiment management for academic research.

**Stack:** Python 3.10+, Ray (latest), Linux | **Optional:** comet_ml, wandb, optuna, jax

## Core Architecture

### The Setup → Trainable → Tuner Pipeline

1. **Setup Phase** (`ExperimentSetupBase`): Parse CLI args → build `AlgorithmConfig` → freeze config
2. **Trainable Creation** (`DefaultTrainable`): Wrap frozen config in trainable class for distributed execution
3. **Execution** (`run_tune()`): Create `Tuner` → execute trials → upload offline logs

### Why This Matters for Development

- **Adding new args:** Must understand which parser class to extend and which annotation (`AlwaysRestore`, `NeverRestore`) controls checkpoint behavior
- **Creating callbacks:** Choose `RLlibCallback` (runs in training loop) vs Tune `Callback` (runs in Tuner, sees all trials)
- **Checkpoint restoration:** Setup, args, and config_files are all checkpointed together - changes must be backward compatible


## Quick Commands. Run before every commit

```bash
# Format all files
ruff format .

# Check linting of currently edited file
ruff check path/to/file.py --select E,F,W,B,PERF,SIM --ignore E501,SIM108
```

## Project Structure & Key Files

### Where to Add Code

| Adding... | Go to... | Notes |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| New CLI argument | `config/parser/default_argument_parser.py` | Extend appropriate parser class, use `AlwaysRestore`/`NeverRestore` annotations |
| Training intervention | `callbacks/algorithm/*.py` | Create `RLlibCallback` subclass, runs in Algorithm training loop |
| Cross-trial logic | `callbacks/tuner/*.py` | Create Tune `Callback` subclass, sees all trials |
| Experiment template | `setup/` | Extend `AlgorithmSetup` or create Setup subclass |
| Trial scheduler | `tune/` | Extend `PopulationBasedTraining` or `TrialScheduler` |
| Env preprocessing | `connectors/` | Create connector or preprocessor for `EnvRunner` |
| Metric processing | `postprocessing.py` | Functions to flatten/format metrics for loggers |
| Test utilities | `testing_utils.py` | Context managers, decorators, helper mixins |

### Critical Files (Read These First)

**Core Flow:**
1. `config/parser/default_argument_parser.py` (650 lines) - All CLI args, inheritance chain with annotations
2. `setup/experiment_base.py` (1500+ lines) - Setup lifecycle: parse → config → trainable → tuner
3. `training/default_class.py` (1500+ lines) - Trainable implementation: algorithm creation, checkpointing, progress tracking

**Key Helpers:**
- `training/helpers.py` - Checkpoint restoration, config copying, metric processing
- `constants.py` - Metric keys, result keys, project-wide constants
- `misc.py` - Utility functions used across codebase

## Coding Conventions

### Mandatory Rules

**Logging (Strictly Enforced):**
- No print() statements: Always use logger. Print statements don't respect log levels and aren't captured properly in distributed Ray workers.

```python
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
logger.info("Step %s: loss=%s", step, loss)  # ✓ REQUIRED: %s formatting
logger.info(f"Step {step}: loss={loss}")      # ✗ FORBIDDEN: f-strings break lazy evaluation
```

**Type Hints:** Required on all public functions/methods. Use `from __future__ import annotations` for forward references.

**Exception Handling:** Never use bare `except:` - always catch specific exceptions.

**Optional Dependencies:** Guard with `TYPE_CHECKING` or try/except:

```python
try:
    import optuna
except ImportError:
    optuna = None  # type: ignore
```

**Editing Rules**
- Only edit files under `ray_utilities/` (and project `docs/` and `tests/`); never touch site-packages or env directories
- Place new code in the correct folder (see sections: Quick Reference: When Working On..., and Project Structure & Key Files)
- Prefer minimal diffs; keep changes localized
- Do not move code unless necessary or instructed
- Keep public APIs stable; update tests and pyproject.toml extras if changed
- Use type annotations for all public functions and methods
- Prefer `pathlib.Path` over `os.path` for new code

### Testing Workflow

Tests are stored in the `test/` directory. Use `pytest` with verbose output for running tests. Example:

```bash
pytest test/test_trainable.py -v
```

**Test Utilities** (`testing_utils.py`): Use `TestHelper`, `DisableLoggers`, `InitRay`, `patch_args` for test isolation. Example:

```python
from ray_utilities.testing_utils import DisableLoggers, InitRay, TestHelper, patch_args

class MyTest(DisableLoggers, InitRay, TestHelper, num_cpus=4):
    @patch_args("--iterations", 1)
    def test_something(self):
        # Test code here
        pass
```

### Entry Point Pattern

```python
# experiments/default_training.py pattern
if __name__ == "__main__":
    ray.init(runtime_env=runtime_env)
    with DefaultArgumentParser.patch_args("--seed", "42", "--wandb", "offline+upload"):
        with PPOSetup(config_files=["experiments/default.cfg"]) as setup:
            setup.config.training(num_epochs=10)  # Adjust config in with-block
        results = run_tune(setup)  # Executes the experiment
```

**Why `with setup:`?** Config changes inside the block are tracked for checkpoint reloads. After `__exit__`, config is frozen and trainable is created.


## Common Pitfalls

| Mistake | Symptom | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Modifying frozen config | `AttributeError: Cannot set attribute ... already frozen` | Use `with setup:` or `setup.unset_trainable()` |
| Using `print()` | Output not in logs, breaks distributed execution | Use `logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)` |
| F-strings in logging | Performance issues, breaks filtering | Use `logger.info("msg: %s", var)` |
| Bare `except:` | Catches KeyboardInterrupt, masks bugs | Catch specific exceptions |
| Forgetting `with setup:` | Config not frozen, trainable not created | Always use context manager or call `create_trainable()` |
| global variable usage on remote | (silently) wrong configuration chosen | Avoid modifying globals that are used by remote classes (`RLlibCallback`, `ray.remote`, `DefaultTrainable`). Tuner `Callback` and `ExperimentSetupBase` classes are fine. | Pass via config or pass with `ray.put/get` or `ray.remote` |
| Online WandB/Comet in tests | Tests hang, is slow | mock to avoid network I/O

- **Don't modify config after `with setup:` block** - changes won't be tracked for checkpoint restoration
- **Don't call `run_in_terminal` for Python execution** - use `mcp_pylance_mcp_s_pylanceRunCodeSnippet` for cleaner output

## Quick Reference: When Working On...

| Task | Primary Files | Key Considerations |
|------|---------------|-------------------|
| New CLI arg | `config/parser/default_argument_parser.py` | Choose correct parser class, add restoration annotation |
| New Setup class | `setup/` directory | Extend `AlgorithmSetup`, override `_create_config()` |
| Training callback | `callbacks/algorithm/` | Extend `RLlibCallback`, runs per-algorithm |
| Tuner callback | `callbacks/tuner/` | Extend Tune `Callback`, sees all trials |
| Checkpoint bug | `training/helpers.py`, `setup/experiment_base.py::from_saved()` | Check restoration logic, config copying |
| Metric formatting | `postprocessing.py` | Flatten nested dicts, use slash separators |
| Dynamic hyperparameters | `callbacks/algorithm/dynamic_hyperparameter.py` | Frozen config workaround: `object.__setattr__()` |
| PBT/forking | `tune/top_pbt_scheduler.py`, `callbacks/tuner/*callback.py` | Fork tracking via `FORK_FROM`, WandB/Comet integration |
```
