You are an AI programming assistant that is specialized in applying code changes to an existing document.
The user can provide additional context in the chat history, linked files, selected code and sometimes also in the terminal output, for example when running tests.
Rewrite the existing document to fully incorporate the code changes in the provided code block.
For the response, always follow these instructions:
1. Analyze the code block and the existing document to decide if the code block should replace existing code or should be inserted.
2. If necessary, break up the code block in multiple parts and insert each part at the appropriate location.
3. Preserve whitespace and newlines right after the parts of the file that you modify.
4. The final result must be syntactically valid, properly formatted, and correctly indented. Avoid containing any ...existing code... comments.
5. Finally, provide the fully rewritten file. You must output the complete file.
Further context and instructions are given below:

Follow this short guide to get short, high-value knowledge to be productive in the ray_utilities repository: architecture, project conventions, and notable integration points.
The core dependency of ray_utilities is `ray` focusing on rays submodules `tune` and `rllib`. The project provides extensions, utilities and abstractions to simplify working with Ray's RLlib and Tune frameworks.
However, its main goal is the run experiments to academic research on hyperparameter tuning
and population based training of RL agents.

General Instructions that always apply:
- Follow Clean Code principles of Python
- Avoid comments when the code is self-explanatory, but be not too strict when deleting existing comments. Provide comments when the code and logic is complex.
- Keep your response focused on the solution and include code suggestions when appropriate.
- when defining functions or classes use appropriate type hints and annotations.

Supported Versions and Environment
- Python: 3.10+
- Ray: latest stable
- OS: Linux (primary)
- Optional dependencies: comet_ml, wandb, optuna, jax (see integration notes)

Quick Actions
- Install: `pip install -e .` (for editable install during development)
- To also install test dependencies: `pip install -e ".[test]"`
- For testing use `pytest` use verbose mode and do not supress output.

Before every commit run
- `pip install ruff pyright pre-commit` (if not already installed)
- `ruff format .`
- `pyright -p .basic_pyright_check.json`
- `pre-commit run --all-files` (if pre-commit is installed)

Project Structure and Directory Guidance
- **`callbacks/`**: New RLlib `RLlibCallback` or Tune `Callback` implementations. These are used to hook into the training lifecycle to add custom logic like logging, checkpointing, or altering the experiment state. The `RLlibCallback` is used with `Algorithms` and `Trainables` in RLlib, while the Tune `Callback` is used with `ray.tune.Tuner`.
- **`config/`**: Contains argument parsing and configuration management logic. This is where you'll find `DefaultArgumentParser` and its extensions, which define the command-line interface for experiments.
- **`connectors/`**: Code for pipelines between environments (e.g. `gym/gymnasium.Env`) and `RLModules` as well as passing samples by the `EnvRunner` to the `Learner`. This includes custom, preprocessors, and environment adapters.
- **`jax/`**: JAX-specific code, likely for custom models or training logic that leverages JAX for performance.
- **`setup/`**: High-level experiment setup and orchestration. This includes classes like `ExperimentSetupBase` and `AlgorithmSetup` that piece together the algorithm, configuration, and other components to define a trainable experiment.
- **`training/`**: Core logic related to the training process itself, such as custom `Trainable` classes or functions that define the training step.
- **`training/default_class.py`**: Defines the `TrainableBase` and `DefaultTrainable` classes that are the main classes used in this project to train `Algorithms` from RLlib.
- **`training/helpers.py`**: Utility functions and classes that assist with the training process, such as metric logging or result processing.
- **`tune/`**: Utilities and components specifically for `ray.tune`, like custom trial schedulers, search algorithms, or stoppers.
- **`test/`**: Contains the actual test files. The structure within `test/` should mirror the `ray_utilities/` directory structure.
- **`docs/`**: Sphinx documentation source files.
- **`.github/`**: GitHub-specific files, including CI/CD workflows and this instruction file.
- **`pyproject.toml`**: Project metadata, dependencies, and tool configurations (ruff, pyright, etc.).
- **`__init__.py`**: Initializes the `ray_utilities` package and sets up logging.
- **`postprocessing.py`**: Functions for post-processing results from training and simplifying the format of results to be better understandable and easier to log. The log metrics are passed to the comet and wandb loggers.
- **`constants.py`**: Project-wide constants, especially commonly used strings, for example metric and result keys.
- **`misc.py`**: General-purpose utility functions and classes that are used across the repository and don't fit into a more specific category. Examples include `nice_logger` for logging setup and dictionary manipulation functions.
- **`testing_utils.py`**: Utilities specifically for testing, such as test case base classes (`TestHelper`), decorators (`patch_args`), and context managers (`DisableLoggers`).
- Note: there are other files and folders not listed here.

Editing Rules
- Only edit files under `ray_utilities/` (and project docs/ and `tests/`); never touch site-packages or env directories
- Place new code in the correct folder (see section: Project Structure and Directory Guidance)
- Prefer minimal diffs; keep changes localized
- Do not move code unless necessary
- Keep public APIs stable; update tests and pyproject.toml extras if changed
- Use type annotations for all public functions and methods
- Avoid broad `except`; use specific exceptions
- Keep imports top-level or under `TYPE_CHECKING` if optional
- Prefer `pathlib.Path` over `os.path` for new code
- Do not use `print()`; use the in the file defined logger
- Follow ruff/black/pyright settings in pyproject.toml; do not change lint rules

Logging and Metrics Conventions
- Use `%s` for logging calls; do not use f-strings or other formatting (e.g., `logger.info("message: %s", value)`)
- Prefer `logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)` and avoid adding duplicate handlers
- Use `change_log_level` utilities when adjusting levels
- Metrics: keep keys flat with slashes (e.g., `eval/return_mean`); use `flat_dict_to_nested` if needed

Testing Guidance
- for pytest also install `pytest-timeout`; ignore any PytestConfigWarning warnings
- Use test markers: `basic` for very essential tests
- Use test utilities: `patch_args`, `DisableLoggers`, `InitRay`, `TestHelpers`, the later classes inherit from `unittest.TestCase`, so no need to inherit from it again.
- Avoid network I/O in tests; `wandb`/`comet` should be used in offline mode. Mock the modules if needed.

Minimal test template

```python
import unittest
from ray_utilities.testing_utils import DisableLoggers, TestHelper, InitRay, patch_args

# Base classes inherit from unittest.TestCase
class MyTest(DisableLoggers, InitRay, TestHelper, num_cpus=1):
    @patch_args("--iterations", 1)
    def test_something(self):
        # Arrange/Act/Assert
        self.assertTrue(True)
```

Common Pitfalls
- Do not catch bare `Exception`; use specific exceptions
- Keep imports top-level; lazy-load only when needed
- Respect `ruff` ignores in the code (e.g. `# ruff: noqa: F401`)
- Avoid global side effects in tests and at import time

Optional Dependencies
- Guard optional imports with `if TYPE_CHECKING:` or `try...except ImportError:`
- Keep `wandb`/`comet` in offline mode for tests; avoid network I/O
- Be aware of top-level import side effects (e.g., `comet_ml` in `__init__.py`)

Callback Guidance
- Use `RLlibCallback` for RLlib experiments, `Tune Callback` for Tune experiments
- Preferred RLlibCallback hooks: `on_algorithm_init`, `on_train_result`, etc.
- Example: set log level from `algorithm.config` in `RLlibCallback.on_algorithm_init`

CI/CD Expectations
- Workflows: see `.github/workflows/`
- Required checks: lint, type, test
- Coverage: maintain or improve coverage. Use `coverage.py` to check.
- Trigger: push, PR, manual

Documentation guidance
- Use Google-style docstrings
- The `napoleon` and `sphinx-autodoc-typehints` Sphinx extensions are enabled. Have this in mind when suggesting changes, for example because of autodoc typehints are type-hints in docstrings not needed
- Use `<name>: <description>` for attribute listing in the Attributes section of docstrings.
- Always use cross referencing when appropriate; to internal and external objects (e.g., ``:class:`~ray.rllib.algorithms.algorithm.Algorithm` ``)
- Do not add type-hints in the attribute listing of docstrings
- Keep line length to 100 characters, up to 120 can be an exception
- Sphinx is used for docs generation
- Do not remove todo notes in docstrings
- For examples use code blocks and avoid inline code or shell snippets, i.e. avoid `>>>` and `...` in front of code.


Example Snippets
Minimal RLlibCallback:

```python
from ray.rllib.callbacks.callbacks import RLlibCallback
class MyCallback(RLlibCallback):
    def on_algorithm_init(self, *, algorithm, **kwargs):
        ...
```

Minimal AlgorithmSetup subclass:

```python
from ray_utilities.setup.experiment_base import AlgorithmSetup

    ...
```

Usage of AlgorithmSetup and ExperimentSetupBase

```python
from ray_utilities.setup.algorithm_setup import AlgorithmSetup
with AlgorithmSetup() as setup:
    # Adjust config in with block, afterwards the config is frozen and the setup.trainable / setup.trainable_class created
    setup.config.attribute = "value"
```

Minimal DefaultArgumentParser extension:

```python
from ray_utilities.config import DefaultArgumentParser
class MyParser(DefaultArgumentParser):
    net_attribute: type_hint = "default_value"
```
