# Project documentation writing guidelines

## General Guidelines
- Write clear and concise documentation.
- Use consistent terminology and style.
- Include code examples where applicable.

## Grammar
* Use present tense verbs (is, open) instead of past tense (was, opened).
* Write factual statements and direct commands. Avoid hypotheticals like "could" or "would".
* Use active voice where the subject performs the action.
* Write in second person (you) to speak directly to readers.

#  reStructuredText (reST) / .rst Guidelines
- Use proper reStructuredText syntax for formatting.
- Maintain consistent heading styles and levels.
- Use bullet points or numbered lists for clarity.
- Include links using the proper reST link syntax to related resources or sections.
- Ensure proper indentation for nested lists and sections.
- Use code blocks for code snippets, specifying the language when possible
